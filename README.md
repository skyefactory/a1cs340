Use:
    o Converts infix & prefix expressions to postfix notation
    o Also allows for postfix back to infix or prefix.
    o Evaluate expression option. Builds an expression tree off of the postfix notation and then evaluates the resultant tree.
    o Visual tree option to see how the nodes connect.
    o Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and brackets.
    o All input characters must be separated by a space. i.e. infix expression ( 12 + 4 ) / 2 
    O If any non number or non operator characters are detected conversions will still be available, but evaluating the tree is not possible.

Infix <--> Postfix <--> Prefix
